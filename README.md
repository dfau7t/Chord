### What is it?

![Circle Of Fifths|200](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*y82hd88gvbmDDHhoy0b8gA.png) 

A Chord instrument where the player only needs to remember the chord name to play it. If he chooses to play the **C Major** chord he only needs to press the button corresponding to it, with the same idea for **minor** chords.

Along with this he can play variations of these chords with additional buttons/interfaces around the main plane, such as the **7th** and the **9th** chords, the **augmented** and **diminished** and so on.

The main concept at play here is that of [[Circle Of Fifths]]. 

## Controls:
24 input buttons corresponding to the 24 basic chords.
2 Octave control buttons.
7th and 9th chord switch buttons.
[[Envelope]] Control Knobs (Attack and Release).
Master Volume Knob
